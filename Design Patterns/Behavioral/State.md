//State
//Intent

//State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

//Usage examples: The State pattern is commonly used in C# to convert massive switch-base state machines into the objects.

//Identification: State pattern can be recognized by methods that change their behavior depending on the objectsâ€™ state, controlled externally.
