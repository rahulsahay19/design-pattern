//Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
//Chain of Responsibility
//Also known as: CoR, Chain of Command 

//Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

//

//Chain of Responsibility is behavioral design pattern that allows passing request along the chain of potential handlers until one of them handles request.

//The pattern allows multiple objects to handle the request without coupling sender class to the concrete classes of the receivers. The chain can be composed dynamically at runtime with any handler that follows a standard handler interface.

//Usage examples: The Chain of Responsibility pattern isn’t a frequent guest in a C# program since it’s only relevant when code operates with chains of objects.

//Identification: The pattern is recognizable by behavioral methods of one group of objects that indirectly call the same methods in other objects, while all the objects follow the common interface.
