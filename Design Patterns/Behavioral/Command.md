//Command
//Also known as: Action, Transaction
//Intent

//Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations.

//Command is behavioral design pattern that converts requests or simple operations into objects.
//The conversion allows deferred or remote execution of commands, storing command history, etc.

//Usage examples: The Command pattern is pretty common in C# code. Most often it’s used as an alternative for callbacks to parameterizing UI elements with actions. It’s also used for queueing tasks, tracking operations history, etc.

//Identification: The Command pattern is recognizable by behavioral methods in an abstract/interface type (sender) which invokes a method in an implementation of a different abstract/interface type (receiver) which has been encapsulated by the command implementation during its creation. Command classes are usually limited to specific actions.
