//Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern, which solves the problem of creating entire product families without specifying their concrete classes.

//Usage examples: The Abstract Factory pattern is pretty common in C# code. Many frameworks and libraries use it to provide a way to extend and customize their standard components.

//Identification: The pattern is easy to recognize by methods, which return a factory object. Then, the factory is used for creating specific sub-components.
