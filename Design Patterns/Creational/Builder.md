//Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

//Usage examples: The Builder pattern is a well-known pattern in C# world. Itâ€™s especially useful when you need to create an object with lots of possible configuration options.

//Identification: The Builder pattern can be recognized in a class, which has a single creation method and several methods to configure the resulting object. Builder methods often support chaining (for example, someBuilder->setValueA(1)->setValueB(2)->create()).

        // Builder interface (at least in a statically typed programming
        // language).

        // Usually, after returning the end result to the client, a builder
        // instance is expected to be ready to start producing another product.
        // That's why it's a usual practice to call the reset method at the end
        // of the `GetProduct` method body. However, this behavior is not
        // mandatory, and you can make your builders wait for an explicit reset

    // may not always follow the same interface.
