//Also known as: Wrapper
//Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

//Decorator is a structural pattern that allows adding new behaviors to objects dynamically by placing them inside special wrapper objects.

//Usage examples: The Decorator is pretty standard in C# code, especially in code related to streams.

//Identification: Decorator can be recognized by creation methods or constructor that accept objects of the same class or interface as a current class.
