//Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

//Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.   
//The Adapter acts as a wrapper between two objects. It catches calls for one object and transforms them to format and interface recognizable by the second object.

//Usage examples: The Adapter pattern is pretty common in C# code. Itâ€™s very often used in systems based on some legacy code. In such cases, Adapters make legacy code work with modern classes.

//Identification: Adapter is recognizable by a constructor which takes an instance of a different abstract/interface type. When the adapter receives a call to any of its methods, it translates parameters to the appropriate format and then directs the call to one or several methods of the wrapped object.
