//Flyweight
//Also known as: Cache
//Intent

//Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.

//Usage examples: The Flyweight pattern has a single purpose: minimizing memory intake. If your program doesnâ€™t struggle with a shortage of RAM, then you might just ignore this pattern for a while.

//Identification: Flyweight can be recognized by a creation method that returns cached objects instead of creating new.
