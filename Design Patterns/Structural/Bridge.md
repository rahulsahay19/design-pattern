//Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

//Bridge is a structural design pattern that divides business logic or huge class into separate class hierarchies that can be developed independently.

//Usage examples: The Bridge pattern is especially useful when dealing with cross-platform apps, supporting multiple types of database servers or working with several API providers of a certain kind (for example, cloud platforms, social networks, etc.)

//Identification: Bridge can be recognized by a clear distinction between some controlling entity and several different platforms that it relies on.
